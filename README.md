Venezuela Travel Agency Page - [Mohammed Awad Design Guide](https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX)
This web page was HTML & CSS Capstone Project of the microverse curriculum.
In this project, I tried to be guided by the excellent design of [Mohammed Awad](https://www.behance.net/M_Awad) to make the Venezuela Travel Agency web portal and for this, I wanted to demonstrate the importance of bootstrap and Sass in the development of receptive portals.
